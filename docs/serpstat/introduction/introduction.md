### 2. Get API Token

*   You need a personal API token to start using Serpstat API.

### 3. Testing

Each user can have only one API token per user.

There are no sandbox, test endpoint or any other test environment.

For testing, we suggest you:

1.   Add a test user account to your team
2.   Give them a small amount of API credits
3.   Use their token as test credentials

This helps avoid accidentally spending your main API credits during testing.
